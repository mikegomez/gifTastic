# gifTastic

gifTastic is a project that is set to render new buttons when you enter in the information into the input section. This will then pass on the values so when you click on the button, it will call the giphy api and render 10 images of what is inputted into the form section.

The program uses a combination of html, css, and js. With the majority of work coming from js. It also has an api from the Giphy website.

The program is meant to be user interactive and also when working properly will have a stop/start function, so when you click on an image the gif will be animate and when you click it again it will pause.
